# Add container Lifecycle management and Kubernetes support

## Summary
Extend **kettle** with full container lifecycle management (create, start, stop, delete) and add Kubernetes integration to run and manage containers as pods.

This project focuses on evolving kettle from a minimal runtime engine into a usable container runtime with clear lifecycle primitives and basic Kubernetes compatibility. The work includes wiring lifecycle on top of low-level runtimes, integrating with OCI concepts, and adding a Kubernetes-facing layer to manage containers through standard tooling.
